'Circles' this, 'Circles' that. I don't like people swearing on my gender, you know.
Hi. You're Billy, right?
My family's rich. Like, RICH. I don't even know what we did to get it all!
You don't know what it's like to be treated like a doll!
People look at me, and they see an impending lawsuit.
I don't think my family likes you very much, Bill.
Every time you say 'I have a plan,' something goes wrong.
This is insane!
