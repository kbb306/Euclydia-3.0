It's a shame this can't last. Good times end too fast.
Choices matter, Billy. And you will have more to make than most.
I'm a lawyer by trade, but I do have other hobbies.
You axolotl questions.
Try not to resent them Billy. They don't know what they're doing.
I'll be here when you need me most.
Is this how it happened? Perhaps once upon a time.
This is an imaginary story...aren't they all?
Things sure do look different from down here.
I hope this helps you one day...
