Aww, you poor little freak!
I'm telling my mom about this!
Teacher! Billy is doing it again!
I don't know WHAT'S wrong with you, but I'm gonna make sure everyone knows about it.
Cipher, Cipher, he's insane. Starting fires with his brain!
Go ahead, burn me. I dare you.
Do you want your mommy? 
Silly straws? At 8?! Circles, you're pathetic!
Your mom pities you, your dad hates you, and everyone else is scared...well, except me.
Does baby want his baby sandwich back?
And people call ME spoiled?
You're cheating! He's cheating!
