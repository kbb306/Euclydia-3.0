Sorry! Didn't see you there!
Is this the Cipher residence?
These houses all look the same...
Oww! Cramp, cramp!
I should have practiced more first.
Do you know where the Ciphers live?
I'm late for my lecture...
What am I going to say to them?
Sorry! 
No, I do NOT need to see the optometrist.
I hope the translator is working Egg Freckles.
Wait-how am I gonna pick things....oh hello stranger!
God, I'm sweating....
Yeah, I'm a clutz, I get that a lot!
Did I blink recently? Did I say that out loud?
