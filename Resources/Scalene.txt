Rock a bye Billy, please don't you cry...
I'm sure it's not his fault.
If you take your medicine, we can spend all day at the park.
He's just a boy Euclid!
You're going to change the world, Billy.
No matter what happens, I will ALWAYS love you.
You can't tell the doctor about this.
You know what you need...
