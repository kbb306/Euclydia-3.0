I'm late for work!
Such a nice day...
Where am I?
There goes Billy again. Poor insane kid.
Two dimensions two and fro...
Shh! Family Matters is on!
I hate this neighborhood!
I'm hungry!
Talk?
Another perfect day in Euclydia!
I hate this song!
I love this song!
WHERE IS MY BRIEFCASE?!
Aren't we supposed to have limbs?
Which building was it again?
"Her aim is getting better?" THAT'S your punchline?
I wanna watch Sinefeld tonight!
I'm bored! Wait is that allowed?
I don't recognize this song...
What's up? I MEAN-
Family Matters again? Why can't we ever listen to something else?
Steer clear of the doctor. He's creepy.
I wish that shape would notice me...
I wonder if I can walk all the way back around...
This light is too bright for my eye.
Oh circles I slept in!
Radio's on the fritz again.
I miss grandma.
Anyone else hear that?
WHY DID YOU DO IT?
